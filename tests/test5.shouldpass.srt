1
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,400
I didn't do it.

2
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,600
You didn't do what?
it doesn't matter what.

3
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,000
Where were you then ????

4
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,700
I was.

5
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,200
So ???

6
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,000
Happy hour.

7
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,600
Little neighborhood place
drinking belfast carbombs

8
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,300
With some
of my westie pals.

9
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,500
You got anyone that can
verify that for me?

10
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,200
Yeah. i got about 30 people
or so can.

11
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,100
Conservative estimate.

12
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,300
How come
i got this crazy hunch

13
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,300
That most of those people
got records a lot like yours?

14
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,600
Well, i wasn't drinking tea
at the plaza.

15
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,000
Look, u want more elblwiess.

16
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,400
Give me an hour or so,
i'll see what i can do.

17
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,700
Must be
pretty well connected.

18
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,500
Friends in high places.
who's mary with the manicure?

19
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,800
I know he's not a cop,
not with that haircut.

20
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm assisting detective beckett
in the investigation.

21
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,400
Assisting?

22
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,800
What's the matter, sweetie? you
can't hack it out there alone?

23
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,800
You wanna play?

24
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,100
Let's play.

25
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
I got an ex-con with a gun

26
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,500
And two fresh homicides
just looking for a home.

27
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,400
You can fish all you want,
detective.

28
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,100
Smart fish don't bite.

29
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,400
We could hold him
on the gun,

30
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,100
But there's no match with
ballistics on mrs. delgado.

31
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,500
And without other evidence to
link him to the other homicide-

32
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,600
I'll find something, sir.
not if his alibi checks out.

33
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,000
Sir, it's just pots and kettles.
on the last robbery, not the first.

34
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,900
Mitchell was being arraigned
on an unrelated burglary

35
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,600
The same day this crew struck.

36
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,000
Unless you can break his alibi
on this one, he's a dead end.

37
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,800
You gotta watch
those silhouettes.

38
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,600
They can be shifty
little bastards.

39
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,800
Do you mind?
i'm trying to concentrate.

40
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,400
Man, when i hit a wall, all i
got's one of those stress balls

41
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,200
And internet porn.
castle-

42
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,800
Look, i get it, all right?
you made a promise

43
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,300
To a daughter
to find her mother's killer.

44
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,700
It doesn't take freud
to see what's what.

45
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,600
But you're gonna run up
some blind alleys

46
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,800
Before you get out of the maze. look, as much
as i appreciate your folksy dr. phil aphorisms,

47
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,500
I just wanna-

48
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,500
Wouldn't it be
more of a challenge

49
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
If they
weren't standing still?

50
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,000
Okay, castle.
you show me how it's done.

51
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,200
All yours.

52
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,000
It's not a duel,
scaramouche.

53
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,200
Here.

54
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,200
Square off to the target.

55
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Feet
shoulder-distance apart.

56
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,100
Okay. gauntlet your
right fist in your left palm.

57
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,900
Shot too soon.

58
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,500
Yeah, well...

59
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,400
You know, we could always
just cuddle, castle.

60
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,100
Oh, funny.

61
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,600
And a smile. good.

62
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,800
That's better.

63
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,600
You know, i, uh, came down
to ask you if i could, uh,

64
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,900
Take home some of those
stolen property photos.

65
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,900
Photos of the jewelry?
why?

66
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,200
I don't know. i just thought
it might spark something.

67
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,500
That kinda hurt.
tell you what.

68
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,900
You put any of the next three
in the ten ring,

69
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,200
And i will give you the files. yeah?

70
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,700
Yeah.

71
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,300
You're a very good teacher.

72
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,500
Hey, dad. hey, how was
your date with owen?

73
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,800
Dad, it wasn't a date.
it was a study group.

74
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,300
Okay, how many in the
group? just the two of us.

75
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,100
Pilfering evidence again,
i see.

76
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,000
<i>borrowing. and these
are just copies. mm-hmm.</i>

77
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,800
Insurance companies
like to maintain photos

78
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,400
Of pieces like these
for identification

79
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,600
In case anything
gets lost or stolen.

80
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,500
Hello, gorgeous! ooh!

81
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,300
Where have you been
all my life?

82
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,500
You know, i'm thinking
of installing

83
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:24,400
A new security system, maybe even a panic
room. panic room? what for, panic attacks?

84
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,700
If anyone comes,

85
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,200
We'll beat them off
with swords.

86
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,400
Or pens, since they're mightier. no,
i'm serious. i just want us to be safe.

87
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,500
Oh, life isn't safe,
especially not in new york-

88
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,700
Cranes collapse,

89
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,900
Air conditioners fall out
of the sky.

90
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,100
In the end, there's just
a few short years.

91
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,200
The most you can do
is make the most of it

92
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Before something
knocks you down.

93
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,700
"people living deeply
have no fear of death."

94
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,800
Anais nin? mother, how many
of those have you had?

95
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,200
Oh, shh.

96
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,500
These are
pretty incredible pieces.

97
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
You wouldn't use
a normal fence for these.

98
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,400
You'd need someone
with impeccable taste,

99
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,900
Someone who appreciated
their value,

100
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,600
Someone who had high-end
buyer connections. powell.

101
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,400
Oh, now there was a man.
and you had to ruin it.

102
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,800
Who's powell? that was years ago. i'm
sure he's forgotten all about that.

103
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,500
Who's powell? forgotten? you
forced him into retirement.

104
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,500
You ruined his life. he threatened to
slit your throat. dad, who's powell?

105
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,900
You remember
that character of mine-

106
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,800
Um, bentley silver? the
jewel thief in "storm rising"?

107
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,300
Yeah, i kinda based him on powell. kind
of? you stole the man's entire life.

108
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,200
And then your father,
genius that he is,

109
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,600
Thanked him
in the acknowledgments,

110
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,300
Completely blowing his cover.
yeah, he can't still be mad.

111
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,400
I'm gonna go see him.
dad!

112
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,800
No, i'll be okay. don't worry. i think it'll
be fine. if he doesn't slit your throat,

113
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,300
Tell him he owes me an
evening at le cirque. dad!

114
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,700
Dad!

115
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,700
I have been waiting
a long time for this, castle.

116
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
What can i say, rick?

117
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,000
You really had it coming.

118
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,100
Yes, i did.
thanks for not killing me.

119
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,700
The carpet's an antique...

120
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,400
Turkish, mid-1600s.

121
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,400
A blood stain on it
would've been a disaster.

122
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,200
Besides, i was ready
to retire.

123
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Being a ghost
is a young man's game.

124
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,600
Good to see you again,
old friend.

125
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,400
And you, as well,
dear boy.

126
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,700
Tell me,
how is martha?

127
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,600
Still a one-woman show
in search of an audience.

128
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,200
She says you owe her
an evening at le cirque.

129
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,900
And to what
do i owe the pleasure?

130
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,200
You're not planning
a sequel, i hope.

131
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,300
What's this?

132
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,300
Stolen jewelry

133
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,300
From that rash
of home invasions.

134
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,500
So very lovely.

135
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
I was wondering if anyone's
tried to fence them.

136
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,900
I've heard nary a whisper
of anything in this range.

137
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,300
The police are holding a guy
named mitchell.

138
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,400
Haven't had the pleasure.

139
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,500
Anything special
about these?

140
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,100
Anything they have
in common?

141
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,500
These are hardly
everyday wear.

142
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,600
I suppose one dusts them off
for that very special occasion.

143
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,100
So then how did our thieves
know they were there?

144
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,800
Seeing comes
before wanting, rick.

145
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,300
These chaps...

146
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,600
May actually live
among their victims

147
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,000
And move
through their world.

148
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,100
Anything else special
about them?

149
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,800
Without seeing
the scene of the crime,

150
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,000
Anything more would be
mere speculation.

151
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,600
Well, the crime scene's
all locked and sealed.

152
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,000
<i>i don't think i could get you in there.
let that be the least of our concerns.</i>

153
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,300
You, uh, don't seem
out of practice.

154
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,400
Just like riding a bike.

155
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,200
Our thieves used
a bump key.

156
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,300
This new generation...
how utterly vulgar.

157
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,800
Rick...

158
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,000
You didn't tell me
they put her in the safe.

159
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,800
What's the significance?

160
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,400
The significance...

161
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,200
Is it's unnecessary.

162
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,600
It's brutality
for brutality's sake.

163
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,500
This used to be
a gentlemen's game.

164
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,700
We were like ghosts.

165
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,900
We could walk through walls
and simply disappear.

166
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,300
But whoever did this...

167
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,300
They're more like vampires.

168
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,900
Just the blood
makes them feel alive.

169
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,300
These aren't the sort of chaps
a fellow in my line of work

170
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,200
Would care to meet by chance
in the dark.

171
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,700
How often
does that happen?

172
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,700
More often than you'd think,
actually.

173
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,100
Ours is a very small
community. and then what?

174
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,800
In my day, we'd usually come
to some sort of an agreement.

175
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,500
You see, there was a code of
conduct among professionals.

176
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,000
Powell.

177
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,200
Castle?

178
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,800
Hey.

179
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,500
What's going on?

180
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,000
You brought a thief
to a crime scene.

181
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,500
It was very helpful.
it was criminal trespassing.

182
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,500
To-may-toh, to-mah-toh. tell your
friend to keep up his disappearing act.

183
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,300
And the next time you show up
at a crime scene without me,

184
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,700
I'll show you how my
taser works. promise? ah.

185
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,100
So why were you there? seeing
if there's anything i missed.

186
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
So?

187
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,900
So?

188
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,100
Was there?

189
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,400
Did mitchell make bail yet?
paperwork's not done yet.

190
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,800
I'm holding him
out of spite.

191
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,800
I want to talk to him. why? we
already know he wasn't involved.

192
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,300
Something powell said.

193
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,100
I think mitchell knows more
than he's saying.

194
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,300
And what makes you think
he'll share it with us?

195
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,300
Not us. just me.

196
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,500
So what are you,

197
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,100
A forensic psychiatrist,
some kind of profiler?

198
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,300
Actually, uh, i'm a writer.
an embedded reporter, huh?

199
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,900
What, are you gonna
make me famous?

200
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,400
Not that kind of writer.
i'm a novelist.

201
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Yeah? uh, anything that, uh,
i might've heard of?

202
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,000
Uh... "storm's last stand."

203
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
"storm season."
derrick storm?

204
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,700
Yeah. i love that guy. why
the hell did you kill him?

205
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,600
It's a long story,
but i'm working on a new one.

206
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,700
And i gotta tell you,
it is very cool.

207
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,000
But i want to get the details right.
they never get the details right,

208
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,800
Not in books, movies.

209
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,600
They always write us
as clowns and thugs.

210
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,900
They never stop to think
that maybe we got mortgages,

211
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,100
Families...
exactly.

212
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,700
Okay, so...
in the new book,

213
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,000
It's about this crew
of home invaders,

214
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,800
Based on the crew
we're looking for right now.

215
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,300
I got this one scene
where a guy just like you

216
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,600
Runs into these guys
by accident

217
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,500
In the middle of a job. wouldn't happen
to me. i'm not doing residentials.

218
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,800
Not at least
until you catch these guys.

219
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,700
These guys are dark.

220
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,100
What, you know 'em?

221
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,800
Their shot caller came into
the bar a few months back,

222
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,100
Looking to put together
a crew.

223
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,500
Wanted to bring me on,
said he had eyes inside

224
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,900
Working up scores for him,

225
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,500
Feeding him
the glengarry leads-

226
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Items, names, addresses.

227
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Said that all he needed
was one of my bump keys.

228
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,600
Did you give it to him?

229
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,600
<i>yeah, i gave it to him,
but just to get rid of him.</i>

230
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,800
<i>i wasn't about to join
his crew. i'll be damned.</i>

231
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,600
<i>why not? like i said,
these guys were dark.</i>

232
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,300
And i'm a 2-minute man,
in and out.

233
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,700
That's my one hard-and-fast.
but this sadistic whack job?

234
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,100
Whoa. he said he liked to play
with his food before he ate it.

235
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,100
All right, this, um,
this shot caller...

236
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,000
If i put him in the book,
i want it to feel authentic.

237
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,900
How would you describe him?

238
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,000
This is the man
who killed her?

239
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,500
We think so.

240
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,700
We believe he may have had
more than just

241
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,200
A passing relationship
with your mom.

242
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,200
And he could be anyone-
a waiter, dog walker,

243
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,300
Doorman, personal trainer...
no, i don't recognize him.

244
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,100
Maybe one of
the other victims knows?

245
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,800
Your mom
wear jewelry often?

246
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,200
No, just to
special events.

247
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,300
What kind
of special events?

248
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,600
Uh, a fashion show
last year...

249
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,000
Gallery openings,
fund-raisers...

250
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,300
My mother
loved her causes.

251
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,200
You know, opera companies,

252
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,000
Environmental groups...

253
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,300
Eyes inside.

254
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,700
Why are we doing this again?
well, according to mitchell,

255
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,500
The shot caller
who wanted the bump key

256
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,100
Had someone feeding him
inside information

257
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,800
About our victims. and powell says
the pieces of jewelry being stolen

258
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
Are the kind you save
for special occasions.

259
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Special occasion,
like a charity event.

260
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,100
So we find
an organization

261
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,000
That all of our victims
supported.

262
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,700
And we find our guy.

263
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,200
Delgado and pastori both gave
to the manhattan opera society.

264
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,400
But not
the last two victims.

265
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,500
I got three families that
donated to a.i.d.s. america-

266
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,900
Delgado, bruner and kesler.

267
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,900
But not pastori.

268
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,500
Maybe pastori was a guest of
one of the other three victims.

269
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,400
No, none of
the families knew each other.

270
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,800
Wait a second.
m.a.d.t.-

271
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,100
That's the metropolitan american dance
theater. metropolitan american dance theater.

272
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,300
Metro american dance...
m.a.d.t.

273
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,900
That's the non-profit our
invaders are profiting from.

274
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,800
Find out who was in charge
and how i can find them.

275
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,300
Right on.

276
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,700
There she is-anne greene,
the company's director.

277
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,700
She can invade my home
anytime.

278
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,300
Yeah, well,
if she's in on it,

279
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,600
She's doing it
purely for kicks.

280
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,200
Textile heiress, no record
and clean dmv.

281
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,900
White centerpieces
go on the angel tables.

282
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,100
Red centerpieces
go on sponsor tables.

283
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,900
Ms. greene,
i'm detective beckett,

284
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,100
And this is-
ricky? ricky castle?

285
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,300
I've heard perfectly
awful things about you

286
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,500
From my friend cheney.
cheney?

287
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,100
Tall, brunette,
aftermarket nose.

288
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,300
Cheney... of course.
how is cheney?

289
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,200
Oh, i hear she's a great
scandal in st. moritz.

290
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,100
Oh.
and you?

291
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,200
Currently between
scandals, actually.

292
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,300
Oh, you two aren't...

293
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,800
Not yet.
no.

294
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,100
<i>never. in fact, um,
ricky here is assisting me</i>

295
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,000
With a homicide investigation.

296
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,100
How exciting. yes, and it
involves your organization.

297
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,700
All of our employees go through
an extensive background check.

298
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,600
I can assure you
none of them are involved.

299
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
I'm still gonna need a list
of the employees

300
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,200
Who had access to donor
records. of course.

301
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,000
Detective, i'm sure
this is all a coincidence.

302
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,700
Unfortunately, i'm not,
and that's why

303
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,300
I'm gonna need a copy of your
donor list. that may be a problem.

304
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,300
The people who give publicly-
they're not an issue.

305
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,000
But some of our donors
cherish their anonymity.

306
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,500
We're contractually obligated
to protect that.

307
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,200
What about their lives?

308
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,300
Do your donors
cherish those, as well?

309
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,000
I assure you, my office
will contact each of them

310
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,500
And alert them
to the situation.

311
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:45,200
I'd really like
to contact them myself.

312
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,400
I'm sorry, detective,
but my hands are tied.

313
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,500
If you want
my confidential donor list,

314
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,000
You're gonna need
a court order.

315
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,700
Awkward.

316
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,200
We ran employees
and volunteers.

317
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
None have priors or records.

318
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,500
Hello?
shh, shh!

319
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,900
What's she doing? writing an
affidavit for a court order.

320
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,500
That no one is going to sign.

321
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,000
Did you see that list
of board members?

322
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,900
Half the judges in town are on it. what am
i supposed to do, just let someone else die?

323
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,100
Whoa, hey. you seem
a little stressed.

324
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,900
Hey, you know what you need?
a night out on the town.

325
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,000
A what now?

326
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,900
What are those?

327
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,500
The gateway
to another world.

328
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,700
Castle.

329
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,900
They hold
four fund-raisers a year.

330
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:36,900
The last one took place a week
before the robberies began. no.

331
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,800
It is perfect. you don't have
to ask who the donors are,

332
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Because they'll all be there,
wearing their jewelry.

333
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,800
If the employees and volunteers
are clean, then our perp... skell.

334
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,100
<i>could be working the party.
and we can work the door.</i>

335
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,500
So it's settled.
pick me up at 8:00?

336
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,600
Oh, it's, uh,
a black-tie event.

337
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,800
That's not a problem, is it? uh, no.

338
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
No.

339
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,500
No, no, unh-unh. that one
goes to the thrift store.

340
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,600
Whoa! "karma chameleon."

341
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,200
The girl at saks said fluorescent is
in. well, then she was on commission.

342
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,000
Too "showgirls"?

343
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,400
You know
what he's trying to do?

344
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,000
He wants to humiliate me.

345
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,200
Lanie, can you
get that, please?

346
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,000
All right, but you better not
be wearing your prom dress

347
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,400
When i get back.

348
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,700
My dad,
nervous for a date?

349
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,700
It's not a date. it's an
undercover operation. uh-huh.

350
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,500
Would you?
yeah.

351
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,100
I don't know why you won't
tell me where the party is.

352
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,400
Because you'll show up.

353
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,300
Who was it?

354
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,600
Delivery.

355
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,800
From who?
let's find out.

356
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,400
"bippity boppity boo"?

357
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,600
"cinderella."
it's from him.

358
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,800
Oh, please, it's a dress.

359
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,200
Now open it up,
girlfriend.

360
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,100
Oh, i knew
he was arrogant,

361
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,500
But this-
this is complete-

362
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,700
Oh.

363
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,800
Stunning.

364
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,100
Simply stunning.
come in, come in.

365
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,100
Oh, hang on. hang on...

366
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,600
You look incredible.

367
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,500
Really?

368
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,300
Really. you clean up nice,
detective beckett. thank you, castle.

369
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,100
I was nominated

370
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,000
For a, uh, tony once...

371
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,500
Oh, no, martha, i couldn't.

372
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,500
Yes, you can. let me-
oh, it's brilliant.

373
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,600
So where are you guys
headed tonight?

374
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,200
Uh, uh, uh, we're going
to the, uh, waldorf.

375
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,300
Man, these guys are guilty
of tax evasion,

376
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,700
Not home invasion.
yeah, well...

377
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,200
Appearances
can be deceiving.

378
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,200
Nice dress. yeah, what there is of it.

379
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,600
I'd let you borrow it,
esposito,

380
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,500
But you stretched out
the last one.

381
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,300
Big cheese!

382
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,300
Ricky! ricky!

383
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,100
Hey, hey, hey!

384
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,200
Why didn't you tell me you were
gonna be at this shindig?

385
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,900
I would've given you a ride. oh,
last-minute thing. listen, mr. mayor,

386
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,200
I'd like to present to you
detective kate beckett.

387
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,100
Kate beckett, you know the mayor.
so this is detective beckett.

388
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,700
It's an honor to meet you,
sir. oh, please, call me bob.

389
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,700
Rick, she's even
prettier than you said.

390
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,100
Excuse me a minute.
of course.

391
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,500
You talk about me
to "bob"?

392
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,600
Well,
we play cards together.

393
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,600
Well, that, and you are the
subject of my next book. huh.

394
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,000
Can i get you a drink?
yeah. vodka.

395
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,800
Lots of vodka. but...

396
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,600
I'm on duty, so... water? yeah.

397
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,400
Vodka.

398
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,700
Could i get two very stiff
vodka martinis?

399
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,500
Don't shake 'em. just swirl
'em around a bit. richard. hi...

400
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,800
Rachel maddox. we spoke on the phone. oh, and
thank you very much for getting me the tickets.

401
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,700
Thanks for the signed
first edition for the auction.

402
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,000
I had my eye on it, but it's probably too rich for
my blood. my boyfriend paul reynolds. he's a huge fan.

403
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,300
Oh, always nice to meet a fan. hi.

404
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,700
Don't sweat it.

405
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,100
That's just rachel,
anne's head of development.

406
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,900
She's only after his money,
so to speak.

407
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,300
Oh, i'm ruthie.
um, beck-

408
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,800
I'm s-i'm kate.
nice to meet you.

409
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,600
Do you work
for the charity?

410
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,800
No. no, but i am
on the circuit.

411
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,500
You know, breast cancer,
land mines.

412
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,800
Oh, you know
what the best one is?

413
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,000
Um, uh, project...
what do you call it?

414
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,400
The one with the lips.
there are a lot of, uh,

415
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,900
Plastic surgeons there
- fish in a barrel. really?

416
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,200
Oh, not that you
need any help from me.

417
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,400
I see you've got
a big one on the line.

418
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,500
Settle in, katie. i hear he's
a fighter. uh-sorry, castle?

419
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,100
Oh, most of the girls
on the register

420
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,800
Have tried to land him.

421
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,700
Rich and handsome-
we call him "the white whale."

422
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,800
Listen, we're having

423
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,500
A little gathering next month
for our top donors.

424
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,600
We're going to unveil plans
for a new rehearsal space.

425
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,200
If you're free, we'd love for you and
alexis to come. you know my daughter?

426
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,000
We make a point to know
as much as we can

427
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,700
About our potential donors
so we can match their interests

428
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,700
With our programs.

429
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,000
So many places just ask you
to write a check.

430
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,200
<i>we want you to know that your
money is making a difference.</i>

431
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,000
Would you excuse me
just for a second? sure.

432
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,000
So creepy.

433
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,300
Negative on anyone
matching our sketch.

434
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,200
How are we doing on vendors
and staff? no red flags yet.

435
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,400
Hey, so what's it like
in there?

436
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,300
Is it buffet
or passed hors d'oeuvres?

437
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,900
Both. hey,
have you seen, uh-

438
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,100
Castle,
what are you doing?

439
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,400
Sorry,
this is the only place

440
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,700
I knew we could talk and
not be overheard. sure it is.

441
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,600
I was just talking

442
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,700
To the head of, uh,
donor development over there...

443
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,300
She seems to know
an awful lot about me.

444
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,800
She's not the only one.

445
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,500
Did you know that they
call you "the white whale"?

446
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,800
The white whale?
mm-hmm.

447
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,300
Not moby-
no.

448
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,400
She's in donor development.
it's her job to know about you.

449
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,000
Besides,
she doesn't strike me

450
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,900
As a criminal mastermind. still, i
think we should take a second look.

451
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,900
Two, three... dip.

452
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,500
Castle, a little help.

453
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,100
It's powell.

454
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,800
The jewel thief?

455
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,700
I don't believe this.
the two of you are in on it?

456
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,900
Don't look at me.
it was his idea.

457
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,500
You really had me going,
didn't you?

458
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,600
The wine, the cheese,
the code of conduct-

459
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,900
And here you are, making me look the
fool. i just wanted to have a bit of fun.

460
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,400
Fun? you call what you're doing
"fun"? castle, what's going on?

461
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,200
They're in on it together.
they've all but admitted it.

462
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,500
I am so sorry. i had no idea
it was such a big deal.

463
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,200
Big de-

To build profiles on
the victims. yo! yahtzee.

506
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,200
Paul reynolds,
a.k.a. chad nellis.

507
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,800
He served on check fraud,
embezzlement,

00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Forgery and grand larceny.

509
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,400
Well, it does no good
to be coy.

510
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,600
I've seen the looks you've been
throwing me all night. shopping, are we?

511
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,300
Paul reynolds,
you're under arrest

512
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,200
On suspicion of theft and conspiracy
to commit murder. let's go.

513
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,800
Where was the badge?

514
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,100
Don't ask.

515
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,100
Yo. b&e, firearms-

516
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,000
Definitely
a step up for this guy.

517
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,700
He's just
a foot soldier.

518
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,200
We're looking for his general.
what happened to the dress?

519
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,200
You didn't think i was gonna interrogate
him in it, did you? we were kinda hoping...

520
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,200
Outta my chair, castle.

521
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,400
Yes.

522
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,000
So you know him?

523
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,600
We met in green haven prison.
a guy like me-

524
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,600
You know they've would've
eaten me alive in there.

525
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,900
But he looked out for me
in the yard.

526
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,300
They-they were all afraid
of him, even the guards.

527
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,400
And when he got out,
he found me. i don't know how.

528
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,700
So it was his idea
to infiltrate the charity.

529
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,700
I was already seeing rachel
at the time.

530
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,000
I mean, i was trying
to go straight,

531
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,100
But he said that i owed him. and so
you just fed him all the top donors.

532
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,300
Everything he needed was
already in the dossiers-

533
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,100
Names, addresses.

534
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,100
I took photographs
of all their jewelry,

535
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:17,500
Put it all on a flash drive,
but he wanted more and more.

536
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,400
Detective, after he beat
that guy to death,

537
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,200
I told him i wanted out.

538
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
But he said that if i quit,

539
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,400
That he'd do everything
he saved me from in prison.

540
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,900
<i>he'd do it to me
and rachel.</i>

541
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Then tell me
where i can find him.

542
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,200
Castle, as a friend,

543
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,700
I am asking you
not to leave this car,

544
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,400
'cause your little hardy boy act...
is gonna get me killed, i know.

545
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,700
More like
get one of them killed,

546
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,600
And i can't have that on
my conscience. understood?

547
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,400
What if i have to pee?

548
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,200
Go, go, go.

549
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,000
Nypd! we have a warrant!

550
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,300
Look, his coffee.

551
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,900
Still warm.
must've just missed him.

552
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:36,800
And roger.

553
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,300
Can i have your, uh,
next position after 1-7-0-8?

554
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,200
This is detective castle
to all units.

555
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
That's a negatory
on the backup.

556
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,500
This dirtbag's all mine.

557
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,400
Looks like
we got the right place.

558
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,100
Police! police!

559
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,800
Stop, police!

560
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,400
Follow him out back!

561
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,400
God.

562
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,000
Out of the car!

563
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,600
I- she told me i actually
have to stay in here-

564
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,800
Out of the car now! okay, okay,
okay, here i come. i'm coming.

565
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
God.

566
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,800
Go ahead...

567
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,400
I need the practice.

568
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,200
We got him.

569
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,300
Get up.

570
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I tried to stay in the car.
i really did.

571
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,200
He hit me in the face,
you know. yeah, i saw that.

572
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,800
That, uh, "go ahead,
i need the practice"-

573
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,000
That was classic.

574
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,100
Castle!

575
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,000
Sorry.

576
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,200
The other pieces
are still in evidence,

577
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,500
But i don't see the harm
in returning this.

578
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,900
How do you get over it?

579
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,200
You don't.

580
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,600
But one day you'll wake up
and you'll find

581
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,600
That you don't mind
carrying it around with you.

582
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,900
At least that's as far
as i've come.

583
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,900
Thank you, detective.

584
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,600
My name's kate.

585
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,600
If you ever need
to talk...

586
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,800
Darling,

587
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,200
Oh, pretty butch,

588
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
I know, right?

589
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,000
Oh, no, i just came to return your
mom's jewelry. you saved my life.

590
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,500
The least i can do is make you some eggs. no, really, i
- i have to get going.

591
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,600
Nonsense!

592
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,000
Tell us all about last night.
we've only heard his version.

593
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,600
All right, um...

594
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,200
Shall i begin at the
red carpet? yes, please.

595
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,600
So we came out...

596
